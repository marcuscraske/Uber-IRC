This is currently a very basic IRC library for .NET, written in C#; this can probably easily be ported to Java and may help people to understand how IRC works from the client-side.

Current features:
> Establish connections to networks.
> Events:
-- Connection success/failure/disconnected
-- Message received
> Ability to specify i.e. nickname, username, name, respond-to-ping and connection password etc.
> CTCP:
-- Ping
-- Version
-- Time
-- Finger
> Connection polling
> Commands managed by methods i.e. sending messages to users, joining channels and user-lists etc.
